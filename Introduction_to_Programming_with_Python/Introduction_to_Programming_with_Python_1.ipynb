There are a lot of ways that you can run Jupyter notebooks, including just locally on your computer, but we've decided to use Google's Colaboratory notebook platform for this workshop.  Colaboratory is “a Google research project created to help disseminate machine learning education and research.”  If you would like to know more about Colaboratory in general, you can visit the [Welcome Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).\n","\n","Using the Google Colaboratory platform allows us to focus on learning and writing Python in the workshop rather than on setting up Python, which can sometimes take a bit of extra work depending on platforms, operating systems, and other installed applications.

If you're not sure which approach to take, feel free to get in touch and we'll talk through options and help you get set up. \n","\n","### Popular editors for Python\n","\n","Today we've been writing and running code in Google Colab, which is one particular version of Jupyter Notebooks. Depending on your projects and what you're working on, you may want to write your code in a text editor.
