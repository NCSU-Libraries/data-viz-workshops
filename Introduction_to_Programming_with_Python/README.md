# Introduction to Programming with Python

These materials introduce fundamental concepts of programming through the Python programming language. Originally incorporated into hands-on workshop delivered as part of the NC State Univeristy Libraries' Data & Visualization Workshop Series, these materials provide a core understanding of variables, data types, control flow, functions, and basic data structures.

## Introduction to Programing with Python–Part 1
