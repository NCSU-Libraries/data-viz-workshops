Depending on your operating system, how you want to write code, and what type of projects you might work on, there are other approaches as well, such as using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). If you're not sure which approach to take, feel free to get in touch and we'll talk through options and help you get set up. \n",
