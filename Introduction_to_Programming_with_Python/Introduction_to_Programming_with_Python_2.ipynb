If you're not sure which approach to take, feel free to get in touch and we'll talk through options and help you get set up. \n","\n","### Popular editors for Python\n","\n","Today we've been writing and running code in Google Colab, which is one particular version of Jupyter Notebooks. Depending on your projects and what you're working on, you may want to write your code in a text editor.
