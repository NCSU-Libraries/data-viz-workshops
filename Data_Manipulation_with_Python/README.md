[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NCSU-Libraries/data-viz-workshops/blob/master/Data_Manipulation_with_Python/data_manipulation.ipynb)

This workshop teaches basic data manipulation with Python using the Pandas library, and will cover topics such as loading data into and out of a Pandas `DataFrame`, performing basic data cleaning, preparation, and analysis, and visualizing relevant aspects of a dataset.

### Prerequisites

You should be familiar with basic Python syntax and fundamental programming concepts such as variables, functions, and control flow. If you need a refresher, check out A Byte of Python (https://python.swaroopch.com/).

### Credits

This workshop was originally written by Simon Wiles, of Stanford Libraries, and co-taught with Scott Bailey at Stanford University.
