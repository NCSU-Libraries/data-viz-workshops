This repository contains materials created by NCSU Libraries for our popular data visualization workshop series. These materials are intended as a resource for anyone who wants to conduct data and visualization workshops.

The workshops are designed to be hands-on with guided activities and then some time at the end for participants to experiment using their own data.
