They're quickly becoming a standard way of putting together data, code, and written explanations or visualizations into a single document and sharing that. There are a lot of ways that you can run Jupyter notebooks, including just locally on your computer, but we've decided to use Google's Colaboratory notebook platform for this workshop.  Colaboratory is “a Google research project created to help disseminate machine learning education and research.”  If you would like to know more about Colaboratory in general, you can visit the [Welcome Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).\r\n","\r\n","Using the Google Colaboratory platform allows us to focus on learning and writing Python in the workshop rather than on setting up Python, which can sometimes take a bit of extra work depending on platforms, operating systems, and other installed applications. If you'd like to install a Python distribution locally, though, we're happy to help. Feel free to [get help from our graduate consultants](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/dxl) or [schedule an appointment with Libraries staff](https://go.ncsu.edu/dvs-request)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"diWLAlRBTsWT"},"source":["## Guided Instruction\r\n","This week we're introducing the Pandas library for Python and working on importing, viewing, and referencing the data.\r\n","\r\n","Content Warning: This dataset contains information relating to violence towards animals.
