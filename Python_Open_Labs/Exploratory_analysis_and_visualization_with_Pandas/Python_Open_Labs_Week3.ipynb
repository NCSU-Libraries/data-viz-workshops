They're quickly becoming a standard way of putting together data, code, and written explanations or visualizations into a single document and sharing that. There are a lot of ways that you can run Jupyter notebooks, including just locally on your computer, but we've decided to use Google's Colaboratory notebook platform for this workshop.
