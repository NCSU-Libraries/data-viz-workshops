## Data Cleaning with R

The purpose of this workshop is to provide participants with hands-on experience cleaning and transforming data. Participants will learn common data cleaning functions from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), which is a set of R packages for data science.

This repository contains the following files: 

* datasets (csv files)
* slides pdf
* data-cleaning-script.R - this file serves as the hands-on activity
* data-cleaning-solutions.R - solutions to the hands-on activity

These files are accessible as an RStudio.Cloud online workspace at https://go.ncsu.edu/cleanr
