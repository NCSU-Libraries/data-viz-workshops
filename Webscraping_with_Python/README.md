# Webscraping with Python 

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NCSU-Libraries/data-viz-workshops/blob/master/Webscraping_with_Python/webscraping.ipynb)

This workshop introduces basic techniques in webscraping with Python primarily using the requests-html library. You’ll learn how to write a script to scrape multiple pages of a website, select particular information from a page, and save that information in a structured file. We’ll also discuss some of the legal and ethical issue involved in webscraping. Attendees should be familiar with basic Python syntax and fundamental programming concepts such as variables, control flow, and functions.
