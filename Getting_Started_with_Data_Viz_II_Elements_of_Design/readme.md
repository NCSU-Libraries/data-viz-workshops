## Getting Started with Data Visualization II: Elements of Design! 


This repository contains materials for the Getting Started with Data Visualization II: Elements of Design workshop at NC State University Libraries. In this workshop, participants will learn the process for making good visualizations and get practice with two tools, Tableau and Raw.

The materials for the workshop consist of a slide presentation (PowerPoint and PDF format), an activity guide handout (Word and PDF format), a dataset (HollywoodsMostProfitableStories.csv), and a Tableau workbook file of example graphs.  

To download the slides, handout, and workbook, click on each file link above and then the Download button. To download the dataset, click the filename and then the Raw button. The raw data will appear in the browser window. This data can be copied into a text file and saved on your computer.
