# Data Visualization with Python

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NCSU-Libraries/data-viz-workshops/blob/master/Data_Vizualization_with_Python/data_visualization.ipynb)

This workshop introduces essential Python data visualization libraries, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, and helps attendees conceptually connect data manipulation with Pandas to these visualizations. During the hands-on workshop, weâ€™ll progress from simple bar plots to more complex compositions and their styles.

### Prerequisites

You should be familiar with basic Python syntax and fundamental programming concepts such as variables, functions, and control flow. If you need a refresher, check out A Byte of Python (https://python.swaroopch.com/).

### Credits

This workshop was originally written and taught at Stanford University by Javier de la Rosa (Postdoctoral Research at UNED) and Scott Bailey.
