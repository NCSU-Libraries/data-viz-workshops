    "By the end of our workshop today, we hope you'll be able to load in data and visualize it in different ways depending on your specific needs and the nature of the data.

    "Clicking the \"Open in Colab\" button you can see after opening the Github link above will create a new temporary copy of the notebook in the Google Colaboratory environment. Clicking the \"Copy to Drive\" button that appears in the menu bar will create a copy of the notebook attached to your own user account, so you can edit it in any way you like -- you can even take notes directly in the notebook.\n",

    "## Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colaboratory\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are a way to write and run Python code in an interactive way. They're quickly becoming a standard way of putting together data, code, and written explanations or visualizations into a single document and sharing that. There are a lot of ways that you can run Jupyter notebooks, including just locally on your computer, but we've decided to use Google's Colaboratory notebook platform for this workshop.  Colaboratory is “a Google research project created to help disseminate machine learning education and research.”  If you would like to know more about Colaboratory in general, you can visit the [Welcome Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Google Colaboratory platform allows us to focus on learning and writing Python in the workshop rather than on setting up Python, which can sometimes take a bit of extra work depending on platforms, operating systems, and other installed applications. If you'd like to install a Python distribution locally, though, we're happy to help. Feel free to chat with a consultant or schedule an appointment with us.\n",

    "> Pandas is a newer package built on top of NumPy, and provides an efficient implementation of a `DataFrame`. `DataFrame`s are essentially multidimensional arrays with attached row and column labels, and often with heterogeneous types and/or missing data. As well as offering a convenient storage interface for labeled data, Pandas implements a number of powerful data operations familiar to users of both database frameworks and spreadsheet programs."
